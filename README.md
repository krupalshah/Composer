# Composer
An easy way to compose interdependent concurrent I/O streams.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/krupalshah/Composer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/krupalshah/Composer)

Composer helps you to compose chains of interdependent input/output 
tasks such as webservice calls, database read/writes 
and file I/O with concurrency support using `java.util.concurrent` APIs. 
It is compatible with Java 8+ and Android.

Most client side mobile/web applications and backend services communicating with each other 
require a framework in which interdependent asynchronous tasks can be glued together. 
There are many libraries out there which do this very effectively, 
but some of them are either not available for all platforms or require a steep learning curve. 
The main aim of composer is just to provide maximum achievable composability with a minimal interface.
